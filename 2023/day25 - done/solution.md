# #90DaysOfDevOps Challenge - Day 25 - Complete Jenkins CI/CD Project - Continued with Documentation

Welcome to Day 25 of the #90DaysOfDevOps challenge. In today's session, we will continue our journey of building a complete Jenkins CI/CD project. In addition to the project implementation, we will focus on creating a comprehensive README for our GitHub repository using a template. The README will provide essential information about the project, its usage, and how to get started with it.

## What is a README file?

A **README** file is a crucial component of any software project. It is a document that serves as an introduction and guide to your project, providing essential information to users, contributors, and other developers. Typically written in plain text or Markdown format, a README file includes details about the project's purpose, installation instructions, usage examples, and any other relevant information.

## Why is a README file important?

A README file plays a vital role in communicating the value and functionality of your project. Here are a few reasons why it is essential:

1. **Documentation**: A README file serves as a centralized location for project documentation. It helps users understand how to use your project, its features, and any requirements or dependencies.
    
2. **Onboarding**: For open-source projects or collaborative efforts, a README file provides a starting point for new contributors. It guides them on how to set up the development environment, run tests, and contribute to the project effectively.
    
3. **Visibility and Promotion**: A well-crafted README file can attract potential users and contributors. It showcases the project's capabilities, highlights key features, and includes relevant badges, images, or GIFs, making it more appealing and engaging.
    

## Useful Resources
