* `docker volume ls`: List all volumes.
    
* `docker volume inspect <volume_name>`: Display detailed information about a volume.
    
* `docker volume rm <volume_name>`: Remove a volume.
    

### Network Management:

* `docker network create <network_name>`: Create a new network.
    
* `docker network ls`: List all networks.
    
* `docker network inspect <network_name>`: Display detailed information about a network.
    
* `docker network rm <network_name>`: Remove a network.
    

### Logging and Troubleshooting:

* `docker logs <container_id>`: Fetch the logs of a container.
    
* `docker exec -it <container_id> <command>`: Execute a command inside a running container.
    
* `docker inspect <container_id>`: Display detailed information about a container.
    
* `docker stats`: Display real-time CPU, memory, and network usage of containers.
    

### Image and Container Cleanup:

* `docker system df`: Show Docker disk usage.
    
* `docker system prune`: Remove unused data such as stopped containers, unused networks, and dangling images.
    
* `docker image prune`: Remove unused images.
    
* `docker container prune`: Remove stopped containers.
    

### Registry and Authentication:

* `docker login`: Log in to a Docker registry.
    
* `docker logout`: Log out from a Docker registry.
    
* `docker push <image_name>:<tag>`: Push an image to a Docker registry.
    

### Tips and Best Practices

* Use descriptive names for containers, images, and volumes.
    
* Keep your Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml files in version control for easier management and collaboration.
    
* Use environment variables in your Docker Compose files for dynamic configurations.
    
* Regularly clean up unused containers, images, and volumes to free up disk space.
    
* Explore Docker Hub and official repositories for pre-built images.
