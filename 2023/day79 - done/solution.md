# #90DaysOfDevOps Challenge - Day 79 - Prometheus

Welcome to Day 79 of the #90DaysOfDevOps Challenge. Today, we'll dive into the world of Prometheus - a popular open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit. Prometheus is widely used in the DevOps community for its powerful capabilities and flexible architecture. Let's explore the key aspects of Prometheus and its components.

## Prometheus: A Powerful Monitoring Toolkit

Prometheus is a feature-rich monitoring system designed to monitor and collect metrics from various targets, providing valuable insights into the performance and health of your systems. It is specifically tailored for dynamic environments and excels in handling time-series data, making it ideal for monitoring modern infrastructure and cloud-native applications.

## What is the Architecture of Prometheus Monitoring?

The architecture of Prometheus monitoring is designed to be simple, yet powerful, following a pull-based model. It consists of the following key components:

1. **Prometheus Server:** The core component responsible for collecting, storing, and processing time-series data. It periodically scrapes metrics data from configured targets using HTTP pull requests.
    
2. **Metrics Exporters:** Specialized components that expose metrics from various services and systems in a format that Prometheus can scrape. They act as bridges between Prometheus and the services being monitored.
    
3. **Time-Series Database:** Prometheus uses its custom time-series database to store the collected metrics data. It is optimized for fast querying and retrieval of time-series data.
    
4. **PromQL (Prometheus Query Language):** Used to query and analyze the stored metrics data. It provides a powerful and flexible way to retrieve specific metrics and create complex queries.
    
5. **Alerting and Alertmanager:** Supports rule-based alerting. When a rule is triggered, an alert is generated and sent to the Alertmanager, which handles deduplication, grouping, and routing of alerts to receivers for notification.
    

Overall, the pull-based architecture of Prometheus allows it to efficiently collect and store metrics data from various targets, making it a reliable and scalable solution for monitoring modern infrastructure and cloud-native applications.

## What are the Features of Prometheus?

Prometheus boasts several key features that make it a popular choice for monitoring:

1. **Time-Series Data Model:** Prometheus stores metrics data as time-series, enabling historical data analysis.
    
2. **Multi-Dimensional Data:** Metrics can be labelled with key-value pairs, allowing efficient querying and filtering based on various dimensions.
    
3. **PromQL (Prometheus Query Language):** Provides a flexible and powerful way to query and process metrics data.
    
4. **Alerting and Alertmanager:** Supports rule-based alerting and notification routing.
    
5. **Service Discovery:** Automatically discovers and monitors new instances as they come online.
    
6. **Pushing Metrics with Pushgateway:** Allows pushing of metrics from batch jobs or ephemeral jobs.
    
7. **Data Retention and Storage:** Configurable data retention to manage storage and handle long-term data requirements.
    
8. **Integration with Grafana:** Can be integrated with Grafana for advanced visualization and dashboard creation.
    

The architecture and features make Prometheus an efficient and reliable monitoring solution for modern environments.

## What are the Components of Prometheus?

The components of Prometheus are as follows:

1. **Prometheus Server:** The core component responsible for collecting, storing, and processing time-series data. It scrapes metrics data from configured targets at regular intervals using HTTP pull requests.
    
2. **Alertmanager:** Handles alerts generated by Prometheus. It deduplicates, groups, and routes alerts to various receivers such as email, Slack, PagerDuty, etc.
    
3. **Pushgateway:** An intermediary component that allows ephemeral and batch jobs to push metrics to Prometheus. This is useful when it's not feasible for Prometheus to scrape metrics directly from these types of jobs.
    
4. **PromQL (Prometheus Query Language):** The powerful query language used to retrieve and process metrics data stored in the Prometheus time-series database.
    

These components work together to enable effective monitoring, data storage, querying, and alerting within the Prometheus ecosystem.

## What database is used by Prometheus?

Prometheus uses its custom built-in time-series database for storing and managing metrics data. This database is specifically designed to efficiently store and query time-series data, making it well-suited for Prometheus' monitoring and alerting needs.

The time-series database in Prometheus organizes the metrics data into time-stamped samples, where each sample represents a data point with a timestamp and a corresponding value. This data model allows Prometheus to easily handle and analyze time-series data, making it a powerful tool for monitoring and visualizing metrics over time.

The built-in database in Prometheus is optimized for fast data retrieval and storage, ensuring that metrics can be efficiently queried and visualized through the Prometheus web interface or integrated with other visualization tools like Grafana. Additionally, the time-series database provides compression and retention mechanisms to efficiently manage data storage and handle long-term retention requirements.

## What is the default data retention period in Prometheus?

The default data retention period in Prometheus is 15 days. By default, Prometheus retains the collected metrics data for 15 days in its time-series database. After this period, the data is automatically deleted from the database, unless a specific data retention configuration is applied.

You've now gained valuable insights into Prometheus - its architecture, features, components, and data retention period. Prometheus is a powerful and flexible monitoring toolkit that empowers DevOps teams to effectively monitor and manage their systems.

Stay tuned for Day 80 of the #90daysofdevops challenge where we'll start a series of DevOps Projects to summarise all the skills gained during the challenge!
